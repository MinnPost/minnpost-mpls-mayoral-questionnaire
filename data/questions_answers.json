{"2013 Mayoral Questionnaire":{"answers":[{"id":1,"candidate":"Mark Andrew","image":"MarkAndrew250.png","summary-1":"My top priority will be to care for our city’s children by ensuring that they are educated and trained for tomorrow’s jobs. ","question-1":"<p>The next mayor of Minneapolis has a moral obligation to be an education mayor. My top priority as mayor will be to care for every one of our city’s children by ensuring that they are educated and trained for tomorrow’s jobs. I want to make Minneapolis schools the first choice for Minneapolis families. <a href=\"http://www.markforminneapolis.com/growinggreatkids\" target=\"_blank\">Read more here</a>.\n</p><p>\nI plan to do this in three ways:\n</p><p>\n1. On day one of my administration, I will convene a Mayor’s Council on Education made up of leaders from various backgrounds to begin immediately bringing everyone together on behalf of our children’s future. As a sign of what’s to come, Mike Ciresi (education advocate and attorney) and Louise Sundin (education advocate and executive vice president of the Regional Labor Federation) have already agreed to co-convene the council. I will work with the Minneapolis Public Schools superintendent, the school board and the community to better prepare students with the skills and knowledge they need to compete for tomorrow’s jobs. \n</p><p>\n\n2. As mayor, I will build safe neighborhoods, stable housing and economic opportunities for all Minneapolis families. Every neighborhood in Minneapolis needs to be a neighborhood of choice: safe, with stable affordable housing, connected to jobs, transit and recreational amenities. \n\n</p><p>\n3. My administration will renew and expand the Youth Coordinating Board (YCB) into a broader partnership focused solely on ensuring success for every Minneapolis child. The YCB is the multi-jurisdictional table where the city, the county, Minneapolis Public Schools and the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board come together to coordinate services for Minneapolis’ children (a board that I helped found in 1985). \n</p>\n","summary-2":"Raising property taxes is not an option. Failing to restore quality to basic services is also not an option.","question-2":"<p>Raising property taxes is not an option. Failing to restore quality to basic services is also not an option. The current mayor is leaving the city on good financial footing, and as the next mayor, I will further his work of fiscal responsibility, while also continuing to provide solid services and invest in projects that reflect our values and build Minneapolis. I will do this in three ways:\n</p><p>\nFirst, I will continue working with the state to bring resources to Minneapolis, including LGA (local government aid).\n</p><p>\nSecond, I will promote tax base growth, which brings in more tax-paying properties and lowers everyone’s property taxes. We will increase our population by 100,000 people to spread out the cost of services. When we create transit, invest in green spaces and the arts and provide opportunities for economic development, people move here.\n</p><p>\nThird, innovation is a powerful way that will help us grow our way out of our current financial challenges. I have a proven record as an innovator in collaboration and service redesign. Intergovernmental collaboration will save money, eliminate duplication and improve quality. I will work with the county, school board, park board and the state to develop, design and implement efficiencies.\n</p>","summary-3":"I would have fought for a referendum and a better funding package. We need to make the best of a bad situation.","question-3":"<p>I would have fought for a referendum and a better funding package, but the Vikings stadium is moving forward and a mayor cannot preside over a hole in the ground. We need to make the best of a bad situation, and the Vikings stadium is an opportunity to create high-quality jobs and to catalyze downtown growth. \n</p><p>\nThe mayor’s vision must be bigger than just the stadium. As mayor, I will advocate to ensure transparency, full community participation and a focus on spurring development beyond the stadium to create tax base to pay for the project. I will lead the city in engaging businesses and our neighborhoods to transcend the project and build our city and our tax base in east downtown, connecting it to the river, campus and to the neighborhoods to the south.  \n</p><p>\nA related opportunity that we have with the Vikings stadium project and growing the Downtown East neighborhood is to connect the jobs being created to the members in our community who need the jobs the most. I plan to ensure that we maximize the public benefit of the stadium development to help us close the jobs gap in our city.\n</p>","summary-4":"I have full faith and confidence in Chief Harteau. ","question-4":"<p>I have full faith and confidence in Chief Harteau, and I have been impressed by her proactive work to change the culture of the Minneapolis Police Department. Her commitment to that change is commendable. Most members of the Minneapolis Police Department (MPD) serve our city residents and businesses every day with bravery and honor. The spate of racist incidents this summer by some police officers is disturbing and inexcusable. I am glad to see Chief Janeé Harteau committed to improving the culture inside the MPD. \n</p><p>\nAs mayor, I will work closely with the police chief to make sure that our police officers reflect the values of our community, including requiring increased training where needed, building closer police-community ties always, and imposing strong and immediate discipline when the situation calls for it. Additionally, we need to build a MPD that reflects the values and diversity of our city.\n</p>","summary-5":"While I am mayor, there will be no co-location of the bike trail, light rail and freight rail (and no shallow tunnel).","question-5":"<p>Let me start with a certainty: While I am mayor, there will be no co-location of the bike trail, light rail and freight rail (and that includes no shallow tunnel). A major transportation union has found a freight rail option that may be feasible. As things stand today, I favor opening the Locally Preferred Alternative process. As part of this, the reroute of freight rail needs also to be considered based on recent research of the United Transportation Union. This needs to happen immediately.\n</p><p>\nIf rerouting freight rail is found unfeasible, I will consider alternative routes for light rail, with a bias towards the option that is fastest and most affordable to execute. Gov. Dayton's action has slowed the process and opened up the opportunity to look at reroute options.\n</p><p>\nI remain committed to finding a solution for how to build SWLRT to connect jobs and people from downtown Minneapolis through to the southwestern suburbs. It must be done right, and in a way that does not unduly burden the city of Minneapolis. Light rail has been an unqualified success in Minneapolis, and I’m very proud of the work I did at Hennepin County as chair of the first committee that voted to move LRT forward. To continue that success, we need to get the route right.\n</p>","summary-6":"I support the proposed Nicollet-Central streetcar line and believe it will be a fantastic addition to our city’s infrastructure.","question-6":"<p>I support the proposed Nicollet-Central streetcar line and believe it will be a fantastic addition to our city’s infrastructure, tax base and livability. This is also a strategy for tax base and job growth. As the Star Tribune reported this fall, “[streetcars] are a modern mode of transit that has had significant impact in redeveloping portions of … other cities” -- including cities such as Dallas, Portland and Salt Lake City. As city-builders know, transit investments lead to housing and commercial investments. <a href=\"http://www.markforminneapolis.com/issues/create-jobs-and-drive-economic-development\" target=\"_blank\">Read more about my thinking and experience here</a>.\n</p><p>\nMy transit philosophy is built around balance and building an interconnected transportation system that improves mobility in every corner of the city for every community, so that it becomes possible for all Minneapolis residents to live their lives utilizing a multimodal transportation system, from traveling to and from work, to getting to the grocery store, going out to a movie and getting to your kids’ piano recital. We need to encourage walking and biking – the Complete Streets model is fundamental to my view of transportation – our streets are, and must be, for everyone. \n</p><p>\nWe also need to provide excellent city services, and as mayor, I will make sure our street-repair efforts are fully funded. \n</p>","summary-7":"The most (and least) surprising is the depth of public passion for closing our opportunity and achievement gaps.","question-7":"<p>What has perhaps been the most (and least) surprising is the depth of public passion for closing our opportunity and achievement gaps, and also the very tangible hope that we can close those gaps. I’ve talked to parents, teachers, students, and concerned residents across Minneapolis, and they’ve all conveyed to me their concern, but also their hope. That passion and hope have really struck a chord for me, and it has fortified my commitment to becoming the next education mayor, so we can put our scandalous gaps behind us and become a more prosperous, vibrant and unified city.\n</p><p>\nAs the next mayor of Minneapolis, I will bring the community together to close those gaps. I recently unveiled my Growing Great Kids agenda, which lays out my proposal to close our achievement and opportunity gaps by improving our schools, creating stable housing and neighborhoods, and bringing together stakeholders to convene a Mayor���s Council on Education to create dialogue and cut through the rancor to create positive outcomes for our kids. I will also turbo-charge the existing Youth Coordinating Board to leverage state and country resources to do more for our most valuable assets — our kids.\n</p>","summary-8":"I will work to rebuild that trust among musicians, management and patrons.","question-8":"<p>The Minnesota Orchestra players have been locked out for more than a year now. That, along with the loss of Osmo Vänskä has created a serious tear in the cultural fabric of Minneapolis, and Minnesota, a tear that’s not so easily repaired. The ongoing lockout puts Minnesota Orchestra itself at risk of losing its identity and institutional integrity. Please <a href=\"http://www.markforminneapolis.com/orchestra\" target=\"_blank\">read my Sept. 19 statement here</a>.\n</p><p>\nThe ongoing labor dispute between the players and management will require rebuilding trust. As mayor, I will work to rebuild that trust among musicians, management and patrons to ensure this essential institution is thriving and growing. I am dedicated to supporting and building the Minnesota Orchestra and our entire arts community in Minneapolis.\n</p><p>\nOur community is deeply invested in a vibrant and healthy Minnesota Orchestra, and I am committed to keeping Orchestra Hall joyously full of music and audience members. I will continue to support Senator Mitchell’s mediation efforts, and I call on both sides to negotiate in good faith within the mediation process. </p>\n","rowNumber":1},{"id":2,"candidate":"Jackie Cherryhomes","image":"JackieCherryhomes250.png","summary-1":"These are not either/or choices. These are gaps that are deeply interconnected.","question-1":"<p>These are not either/or choices. These are gaps that are deeply interconnected with each other. You can’t find affordable housing without a job that pays a living wage, and you can’t get a job without a quality education. These are complex issues, and I encourage you to <a href=\"http://jackiecherryhomesformayor.com/\" target=\"_blank\">go to my website</a> to see my in-depth plan. That being said, here are three steps that I will take as Mayor to begin to address these issues:</p><p>\n1. Regarding education: On Day 1 as Mayor, I will meet with MFT, the superintendent and leaders of the reform movement. Starting from the position that all sides agree the focus must be on our families and children, we can begin the process of coming to a genuine resolution.</p><p>\n2. Regarding job creation: Reorganize and refocus the Department of Community Planning and Economic Development with an eye toward long-term city planning and job creation. Specifically I will create a position at City Hall where the sole focus is diverse job creation across the city. </p><p>\n3. Regarding Housing: Charge CPED to bring together public/private sector to identify locations/resources to build senior and affordable housing throughout the city with goal of life-cycle housing in every community. Simplify permitting process for construction of housing. This will be completed in first 100 days.</p>\n\n","summary-2":"Raising taxes is not an option for me. Property taxes are regressive.","question-2":"<p>Government has four choices in building a budget: 1. cut services 2. raise taxes 3. redesign government 4. grow the tax base. Raising taxes is not an option for me. Property taxes are regressive and disproportionately affect those least able to pay, like seniors who bought homes at a modest price and have seen their asset and taxes increase over the years.\n</p><p>\nSimilarly, taxes must not be a deterrent to growing our tax base by bringing and keeping young families in our city. As mayor, I am committed to keeping property taxes at their current level or lowering them, if possible. As mayor, my focus will be on government redesign and innovation.\n</p><p>\nI will work with employees and private sector expertise to examine each department for innovations/efficiencies. We have an opportunity to grow our tax base, but it must be planned and intentional.  I will charge CPED to work with the development community and neighborhoods to develop a strategic plan for density. We have opportunities for growth and development, along our transit corridors, vacant parking lots in downtown throughout our city, but development must be sensitive to neighborhood character.\n</p>\n","summary-3":"I have concerns about the financing plan, but with the stadium moving forward, we need to focus on how to make it work.","question-3":"<p>The public has a right to be concerned about the Vikings stadium. While I support the stadium being in Minneapolis, I have concerns about the financing plan. That being said, I believe the stadium is moving forward and we need to focus on how to make it work the best for all of us.\n</p><p>\nI think the anger about the financing is overshadowing some of the excellent work being done with regards to the stadium. As mayor, I am committed to an open/transparent process with maximum neighborhood/community participation.\n</p><p>\nAs mayor, my goals are: 1. to ensure maximum employment/contracting opportunities for city residents; 2. development that is green, sustainable, open and accessible; 3. any development around the site provides housing opportunities for all income ranges; 4. any development around the site involves employment and tax base growth. There is an excellent plan in place to ensure maximum participation in the workforce by women/minority contractors and construction workers.\n</p>\n","summary-4":"We must make it a top priority to create an environment that will not tolerate racism, bias and bullying.","question-4":"<p>To a large extent, most of our police officers handle the challenges of their work with professionalism and a genuine desire to serve the population of Minneapolis. Unfortunately, the actions of a few officers have greatly tarnished the reputation of the Minneapolis Police Department.\n</p><p>\nI believe that Chief Harteau has taken the correct first steps to address these issues. However, we must make it a top priority to create an environment that will not tolerate racism, bias and bullying. Officer screening, selection and training must be continually reviewed and improved. There must be clear expectations for behavior, including policies for swift disciplinary action with problem officers.\n</p><p>\nThe Office of Police Conduct Review is as not as strong as it needs to be, and I am concerned with any process that allows the chief of police to have a tie-breaking vote. As mayor, I would restore the Civilian Police Review Board, working with the community to structure the board in a way that brings attorneys, retired police officers and nonprofit agencies together under a citizen chair.\n</p><p>\nI do not believe it is appropriate to address the retention of Chief Harteau at this time, or in this forum.\n</p>\n","summary-5":"I have serious reservations about the shallow tunnel and its impact.","question-5":"<p>I support the leadership provided by Mayor Rybak on this critical issue. I will follow his leadership by being an active participant in the SWLRT process. I am very familiar with all the issues relating to the SWLRT, having worked on this route for the past seven years for clients in my consulting business. Having represented interested neighbors, I fully understand the issues.\n</p><p>\nI support the decision by Gov. Dayton to re-examine the options for the route as it goes through St. Louis Park/Minneapolis. Promises were made to the Minneapolis neighborhoods many years ago that the freight rail would be relocated. Unfortunately, those promises were not codified in a document that can now be relied upon.\n</p><p>\nI have serious reservations about the shallow tunnel and its impact on the lakes and affected neighborhoods. As mayor, the first key decision will come after the 90-day study period. That decision will be whether or not to support the proposed route. My overarching principle in making a decision will be to not impact our lakes and natural resources and to minimize any impact to our neighborhoods. As mayor, I will ensure maximum participation for the neighborhoods before making that decision. I will work the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board and the council members for the affected communities.\n</p>\n","summary-6":"I support the idea of streetcars as part of a longer-term approach. We must also address the need for better bus service.","question-6":"<p>If our city is to grow, we must have a transit system that works for all its residents. Minneapolis must create a functioning multi-modal transit system that connects people to jobs and to each other. We cannot rely on a one-size-fits-all solution to our transit problems.\n</p><p>\nFirst, I support the idea of streetcars as part of a longer-term approach. However, we must review both the financing package and determine who will run the streetcars. Building a multi-modal transit system should be done in partnership with the Met Council and the State of Minnesota. Minneapolis taxpayers should not be responsible for paying for a transit system separate from the larger system.\n</p><p>\nSecond, we must address the need for better bus service. As it stands, North and Northeast Minneapolis are effectively cut off from the rest of the city, and from the greater Metro area where many jobs are. As mayor, I will partner with Metro Transit to determine how we can create safer, more effective services, and I will ask the Met Council to review all routes and ridership information to assess whether there are better ways to serve the community.\n</p>","summary-7":"One of my strengths is the ability to find common ground among various education groups.","question-7":"<p>During this campaign, I have discussed education strategies with MPS leadership, the MFT and members of the education reform movement. Everyone has good ideas and is committed to providing an excellent education for our students.\n</p><p>\nWhat has surprised me is the anger and the misinformation each has about the other. One of my strengths is my ability to bring people together, to build consensus and find common ground. I see an opportunity to do that here. The positions are not that far apart – the rhetoric has gotten in the way of finding consensus. As mayor, I believe I can bring the parties together and bridge the gaps.\n</p>\n","summary-8":"I would convene a task force with two goals: to get the orchestra playing again, and to create a proper funding stream.","question-8":"<p>Recently I held a joint press conference with former Council Member Dan Cohen and Gov. Carlson around this very issue. The Minnesota Orchestra is the crown jewel of our city, and we cannot allow the lockout to continue. A great city must have a great orchestra.\n</p><p>\nThe Minnesota Orchestra is a strong draw for our existing community as well as an attracter to bringing new residents and new businesses to Minneapolis. As a community, we must support the arts even as we support professional sports. Before taking office, I would convene a task force and I would ask Gov. Carlson to take the lead. This task force would have two primary goals: first, to get the orchestra playing again. Second, to create a proper funding stream to avoid a recurrence of this situation.\n</p>","rowNumber":2},{"id":3,"candidate":"Dan Cohen","image":"dancohen250.jpg","summary-1":"The real gap is an economic gap, a rich/poor gap.","question-1":"<p>If I read the questions correctly, I get my choice of gaps. OK, I choose the education/achievement gap. I have written and commented on this several times, but I'll have another go at it here.\n</p><p>\nConventional wisdom is that this is a racial gap, black/white. I beg to differ. In the first place, I believe this stigmatizes black kids and makes it even harder to close the real gap. In the second place, despite all the programs and rhetoric, we have been unable to close the gap on the basis of this black/white premise.\n</p><p>\nIn my opinion, that is because this is a false premise. The real gap, in my opinion, is an economic gap, a rich/poor gap. Kids from two-income, two-parent families, regardless of race, do better in school than kids in single-income, single-parent households. I cite “Coming Apart” by Charles Murray and the Maslow Hierarchy of Need.\n</p><p>\nIn single-parent households, the parent is usually a mom, working long hours, often with little time and energy left at the end of a tough day, to provide the kids with the kind of parental oversight and family experiences that a kid in a two-parent, two-income family gets. In addition, a kid that does not know where his or her next meal is coming from, or it’s just a bag of chips, may not even be certain there is a home to come home to, and is not going to be motivated to do well in school.\n </p><p>\nThat kid also will not have the cool clothes and good stuff that his or her peer groups with two-parent income and two-parent families possess, another motivating factor for school performance.\n </p><p>\nThe solution to this situation is to find jobs for absent dads and get them back in the home. They are not absent because they are morally depraved. They are absent because they can't support a family. Dads, the same as everyone else, enjoy family life. A strong jobs/growth program will help solve that problem and provide kids with the family support and the income that will help them concentrate on school, rather than fundamental human needs and they will get better grades and close the achievement gap.\n</p><p>\nIs this the only answer to the problem? No, of course not. It is just one answer. Should we abandon the black/white programs? No, they may kick in. But it's time to try a different approach, and that is what I am suggesting here.\n</p>\n","summary-2":"The key is cutting foolish and unnecessary spending and vigorously pursuing a jobs policy.","question-2":"<p>I'll quote myself from my flier for this one: The key to lowering property taxes is cutting foolish and unnecessary spending and vigorously pursuing a jobs policy that will spread the cost of government over a growing population.\n</p><p>\nOn spending, I oppose adding streetcars to our transit mix. They are not an advancement; they are a throwback. Ninety percent of our transit needs have already been met by buses. (The Strib says 85, the mayor says 90). Buses can do the last 10 percent as well.\n</p><p>\nAlso, we should not be laying the burden of half a billion dollars for the Viking stadium deal on the backs of Minnesota taxpayers, whether in the form of income taxes or property taxes or both. We need a much better deal than this one. Minnesota has the lowest rate of starting new businesses of any state in the nation (Strib, 4/20). We need new businesses and the jobs that come with them.\n</p><p>\nFor starters, I support a downtown casino. It will create hundreds and hundreds of jobs. It will be a tax-paying machine, generating property taxes, personal income taxes, corporate income taxes, operating fees and licensing fees, as well as serving as a year-round tourist attraction. I would add that we already have a downtown casino in Duluth and a federal judge just laid a $10.4 million judgment on the Chippewa tribe, payable to the City of Duluth. Don't like property taxes? Well, the mayor of Duluth says he's going to use the money to fix the streets. In Minneapolis, we use property tax money, and we don't fix the streets.\n</p>\n","summary-3":"Give the people the vote, instead of giving them the bill.","question-3":"<p>Well, I'd start with giving the people the vote, instead of giving them the bill -- and the shaft.</p>","summary-4":"Police misconduct is a case where city officials should have spoken with one voice","question-4":"<p>Another issue I've covered at some length. To start with, the cops who made the stupid, racist remarks in the Green Bay and Apple Valley incidents should have been fired on the spot, their lockers cleaned out, and their stuff put out on the sidewalk.\n</p><p>\nInstead, everyone, the chief, the mayor, various members of the council, myself included, all ran off in different directions, and so far as I know, after the usual calls for more study, more training, 0ore this, more that, nothing was done to stop this sort of behavior in its tracks.\n</p><p>\nThis was a case where city officials should have spoken with one voice -- the mayor, the chief, every council member, all the candidates -- one voice. We should have a crisis management committee to deal with these kind of incidents, responsibilities clearly assigned, and a unified single voice, representing every nook and cranny at City Hall, speaking out and saying what needed to said and what was never said, and that is this: There is not a single institution in this country that would have tolerated this behavior. It is particularly intolerable when it is cops, because the mission of the  police department is totally dependent on the good will and support of the public, particularly minority citizens, to perform its function effectively. Engage in this kind of behavior, and YOU ARE GONE.\n</p><p>\nAs for candidates for various jobs, nice try, but it is illegal to promise anyone a job when you run for public office. If I am mayor, I will interview candidates. I will consult with people whose opinion I respect. Tony Bouza has an opinion. I read about it in the June issue of the Southside Pride. I will talk with him. Maybe I will try to lure him back from retirement. He will say 'no.\" But even if his lips say, \"No ,no,\" I will take a close look and see if his eyes say, \"Yes,yes.\" We'll see.  \n</p>\n","summary-5":"I oppose co-location. The Midtown Greenway alternative route needs to be explored.","question-5":"<p>There's a 90-day hiatus here, courtesy of the governor. I concur with the mayor's \"no\" vote. Let's see what they come up with this time. I oppose co-location. Some experts say that freight trains can't make the grades and turns in St. Louis Park. Some experts say they can. \n</p><p>\nThe geological problems posed by soil and water table conditions have not been satisfactorily resolved. Even as we speak, there is flooding and digging going on at  the site of the lagoon between Lake of the Isles and Calhoun where the basement of a new apartment building at Lake and Knox has flooded and it appears there was water pumped into the lagoon.\n</p><p>\nThis could compromise the so-called tunnel solutions, along with the possibility of 900 daily hoots and whistles from the train and no station in the city. The Midtown Greenway has been suggested as an alternative route. That needs to be explored.\n</p><p>\nWhat am I likely to do if I don't like the answer? I'm a lawyer. What do lawyers do when they don't like something? \n</p>\n","summary-6":"Expanded bus service. Streetcars are an expensive toy that we can ill afford.","question-6":"<p>Expanded bus service. As I noted previously, 85 or 90 percent of our transit needs are already being met by buses. They can finish the fraction of the job still needed. One of the mayoral candidates who isn't given much attention, but should be, is a civil engineer named Bob Carney. His idea is small, 15-passenger buses that, unlike our big monster buses, can navigate narrow neighborhood streets, have low emissions and would run on schedules as frequent as every five minutes, so people don't have to freeze to death waiting for transit downtown in the dead of winter.\n</p><p>\nParticularly since the proposed route ends up at the back end of the KMart that has been blocking Nicollet Avenue southward from Lake Street for the last 30 or so years. The best vote I ever cast in public office was my vote against this civic disaster. If somehow the streetcar could be the tool that blasts through the back end of that KMart so we could finally revive Nicollet as a commercial corridor between Lake and 42nd Street, I might, in a weak moment, reconsider, but I'm not there now, and I do not believe that streetcars will revitalize Broadway.   \n</p>","summary-7":"The \"most surprising\" thing is that nothing surprises me anymore.","question-7":"<p>Well, I've already answered that one in Question 1. The added wrinkle here that is \"most surprising\" is that nothing surprises me anymore.</p>","summary-8":"The Minnesota Orchestra is an economic and cultural asset. I will [work] to save the Minnesota Orchestra. ","question-8":"<p>Now here is one situation that does surprise me. With $500 million laid on the Minnesota taxpayers' backs for the Viking stadium so we can do business with a \"civil racketeer,\" and $200 million for an unnecessary toy like streetcars, we are overlooking our most immediate and essential civic asset, the Minnesota Orchestra, with an immediate need of $6 million if it is to keep functioning until a permanent solution can be found.\n</p><p>\nThis is an institution that is a worldwide advertisement for Minnesota as a cultural center of the first magnitude. Last year, the Minnesota Orchestra performed to an audience of 300,000, and 70,000 attended free concerts. The Vikings performed to an audience of 500,000, and nothing is free. Tickets to a Minnesota Orchestra performance cost less than tickets to the Minnesota Vikings.\n</p><p>\nThe Minnesota Orchestra is an economic as well as a cultural asset. It is a major draw for attracting the kind of highly skilled unique talents we need to sustain and grow our economy.  And shall we compare the relative quality of Minnesota Orchestra performances with those of the Minnesota Vikings? We cannot afford to lose the Minnesota Orchestra.\n</p><p>\nFortunately, we have the leadership of one of those exceptional leaders that Minnesota produces, former Gov. Arne Carlson, who is prepared to storm the gates of any gate you can think of if that's what it takes to get the money we need to get this job done. I am signed on, body and soul, and as mayor, I will hector, harass, beg, plead with all of the city, county and state powers that be to save the Minnesota Orchestra. \n </p>\n\n","rowNumber":3},{"id":4,"candidate":"Bob Fine","image":"BobFine250.png","summary-1":"We need to improve the economic climate in various parts of Minneapolis to eliminate the gaps. ","question-1":"<p>We need to improve the economic climate in various parts of Minneapolis to eliminate the gaps in employment, housing and education. To do this, we need to focus on bringing business to the city, specifically focusing on attracting business to disinvested areas, such as West Broadway Avenue. As mayor, I will meet with executives of companies, both large and small, to explore how we can attract these businesses to Minneapolis by reducing taxes, lessening regulations and offering incentives. With an increase in business in underserved neighborhoods, more quality jobs will be available to people in these neighborhoods. \n</p><p>\nIt also is important to make sure Minneapolis residents have the proper training to be ready for these quality jobs. This training starts with great public schools and job training programs. We must hold principals and administrators accountable to support and fairly evaluate teachers. And teachers must receive proper cultural competency training, use challenging curriculum.\n</p>\n","summary-2":"We need to reduce inefficiencies in government, as we have done with the Park Board. ","question-2":"<p>To prevent yearly increase in taxes, we need to reduce inefficiencies in government, as we have done with the Park Board. If the government runs more efficiently, we can return money to taxpayers without compromising core services provided by the city. We also need to explore how we can increase revenue.\n</p><p>\nWe also must make every effort not to increase spending. The mayor is proposing a 1 percent decrease in taxes for next year, but the proposal includes an increase in spending by $24 million. How is that? The city is getting an increase in state aid, has money left over from over-budgeting last year and additional items. The additional state aid should be returned to taxpayers. \n</p>\n","summary-3":"I will use my background in real estate development and real estate law as an asset.

We must better focus police toward community policing and on crimes that affect people. The police must work harder to establish trust between the force and communities or else effective policing will continue to be elusive in certain communities that are affected.

Other candidates have promised to lobby the state and federal government for more funding. They have suggested a Mayor’s Council on the achievement gap. These are not bad ideas, but they miss the central point – the mayor must be a leader who rallies the community behind our superintendent and demands results.\n</p><p>\nI am the only candidate who has publicly supported Superintendent Johnson’s transformational SHIFT plan. SHIFT will create innovative partnership zones, increase diversity in the teaching ranks and allow schools to hire teachers who best match student needs. I will rally the community behind this transformation of our schools\n</p><p>\nI will support SHIFT by leveraging our existing assets to support our kids. I will partner with the county, School Board and Park Board to commit dollars over 10 years to create learning labs and early childhood centers in our parks. I will pay for this initiative by using the same property tax dollars that other candidates would use for three miles of the Nicollet streetcar line that does not address our transit needs. \n</p>\n","summary-2":"We must grow our city through transit investments, development of the Upper River and creating living-wage careers.","question-2":"<p>It’s time to invest in people over politics, people over projects. We must grow our city through smart transit investments, development of the Upper River and creating living-wage careers for our citizens. This will grow our tax base and reduce the pressure on property taxes.\n</p><p>\nI disagree with Council Members Hodges and Samuels on the proposed $65 million subsidy of the Ryan Development adjacent to the new Vikings stadium. This project and other development subsidies put tax dollars at risk and threaten to increase our property taxes. And I also disagree with diverting $60 million in new tax revenue to the Nicollet Mall streetcar line, which does not advance our greatest transit issues.\n</p><p>\nMinneapolis recently received a D- for financial transparency. Citizens do not know how their money is being spent. This must change. I pledge to create checkbook-level spending information so that all taxpayers can see exactly where and how their money is being spent. Transparency builds trust, and trust is the foundation for great teamwork.\n</p>\n","summary-3":"[We should] use what remains of the anticipated sales tax revenues to create a capital fund for our neighborhoods.","question-3":"<p>The dedication of almost $700 million of city funding to the Vikings stadium was a betrayal of our neighborhoods and the people most in need. My opponents who voted (or would have voted) for the stadium funding plan, have stated that they believe this is a good deal for Minneapolis. I strongly disagree. These sales tax revenues could have been used for capital projects in our neighborhoods – affordable housing, the Upper River development, neighborhood action plans, and commercial corridor redevelopment. \n</p><p>\nThe city must not make the same mistake again. The city is negotiating right now to pay for the renovation of the Target Center, using most, if not all of what is left of the anticipated sales tax revenues that could be used to improve our neighborhoods. I will not allow this to happen. The best way to bring the community together is to use what remains of the anticipated sales tax revenues to create a capital fund for our neighborhoods to invest in affordable housing and economic development in our community. \n</p>","summary-4":"I support Chief Harteau and her MPD 2.0 plan to bring transparency, accountability and integrity to the department.","question-4":"<p>I support Chief Harteau and her MPD 2.0 plan to bring transparency, accountability and integrity to the department.
